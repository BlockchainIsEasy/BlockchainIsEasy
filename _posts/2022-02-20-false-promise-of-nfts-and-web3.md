I find a lot of people who are struggling to understand how web3 will replace the internet or how  NFTs will make you rich. Here is my take on the topic, they probably won't. Now before you start clapping or pulling your guns out, let me explain.
I had a hard time trying to understand the promise and value of blockchain as a technology - most of the discussions nowadays around blockchain are focused on NFTs and web3. I see a bunch of teenagers on Instagram bragging about how they made thousands (some of them claim to have earned billions!) of dollars flipping NFTs. NFTs do not do anything miraculous, they just keep a track of who created them and how many and whose hands they have changed till date - This might be a really handy protocol for artists and creators to claim ownership and credit for creating digital art of any form, but this is no reason for the portrait of a monkey to be valued at millions of dollars.

<b>Why NFTs probably won’t make you rich : </b>

The fundamental problem with NFTs is everyone buys them to sell them at a higher price - nobody (alright, there might be a few exceptions) buys them to use them. So rather than looking at people who are into NFTs as people who are investing in the ‘latest technology’, I prefer to think of people trading in NFTs as people who are trying to flip houses or trying to resell pieces of art at a higher rate than they bought.
Moreover, 80% of the $40 billion NFT market is owned by 9% of the accounts - so the prices do not seem to be dictated by the market but by a bunch of rich people who have money to spare.

I follow the school of thought where asset is worthy of purchasing if it has an underlying value -

* Company stocks derive their value because of the underlying business and its current and potential profit.
* Commodities have value because most of them are used as raw materials in various industries.
* Real Estate has value because you literally own a piece of land - farm it, build a house or build a commercial complex, as long as you have capital, you are sorted.
* Precious metals and crypto currencies derive their value because of their scarcity and demand - which decides its price.
* Fiat currencies have value because they are backed by full sovereignty of a government and its value is determined by various macro economic factors.

What gives NFTs value? You cannot use NFTs to generate value nor is there government backing for NFTs to make them a legal tender. Anyone can create them - therefore, they are not a good store of value. Using NFTs, anyone can prove who owns them and who created them. Is that feature good enough to value the digital picture of a monkey at a million dollars? I do not think so. You can probably use NFTs to prove someone owns a piece of land or a block of gold or even a piece of art - which will make NFTs more of a contract proving ownership than an asset to own and sell.

<b>Why Web3 might not bring the democratization of internet we expect :</b>

It won’t be an exaggeration to say that the internet is now owned by a handful of corporations. With the advent of blockchain and its capacity to carry out transactions, people thought we could finally democratize the internet, moving the power which is centralized in the hands of those handful corporations to the users who use the internet. VCs rush to fund Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) which are supposed to be inherently democratic. Now let us take a step back and inspect the type of democracy these DAOs on blockchain have.
    
Most DAOs tend to follow the following pattern - 

* A bunch of people find try to solve a problem using blockchain
* They either create a new chain with its own crypto currency or create a token on existing blockchains like Ethereum
* Once the product has been built, massive amounts of crypto tokens/currency of the project are allocated to VCs which funded the project and the developers which worked on creating the DAO. Usually most DAOs have something called ‘The governance Token’ which will be used to vote on decisions regarding the future updates of the DAO. These tokens are usually owned by the creators of the DAO and the VCs which funded the project - this is not very different from stocks of a company ( except probably, stocks are regulated unlike current state of crypto )
* After distributing among themselves, these crypto tokens/currencies are distributed to the public - the supply or demand of these public tokens will determine the price of the tokens and has made a bunch of founders and VCs millions of dollars.

As you can see in the chart below, governance power in web3 organizations is concentrating in favor of insiders as time passes.

<b>Don't get me wrong</b>

While it is difficult to put a price on art, the market of art collectors and sellers has been a niche one till the advent of NFTs. Since art like paintings, music or digital art has been sold on the internet as NFTs, the market has expanded and more users from different parts of the world are able to buy such art. Artists who create music and digital art are able to directly sell their pieces to the users as NFTs. But one needs to ponder  whether one is buying music (or digital art) for listening or selling it at a higher price because it is an NFT.

Web3 on the other hand, like I mentioned earlier in this article, has an amazing potential for transparent and good governance of Organisations. Instead of treating organizations on Web3 whose governance power is concentrated with a bunch of founders and funders as ‘democratized’, it would be more appropriate to think of them as organizations with technologically enforced governance policies which are transparent.

<b>Why this won’t affect the promise of blockchain as a technology : </b>

In one of his interviews, Elon Musk said something which really resonated with me -
Engineers nowadays tend to solve the wrong problems and try to make the wrong things more efficient. That is probably because of our education system where we are only taught to answer questions but discouraged from questioning whether we are asking the right questions.

For decades people have been trying to transfer value and currencies using the internet which was created to transfer information and for decades people have tried making the process of transfer of value via the internet efficient. Now, with the advent of blockchain technology, we have means to transfer value from one place to another without using the internet. This can make the underlying technology for payments all over the world more transparent and efficient. One can say that Ethereum in its current state has higher transaction cost, low throughput and higher transaction time than visNet - a digital electronic payments system on the internet (Web2). But this is because Ethereum is decentralized ( and the Ethereum community is working towards making it much more efficient as we speak ). This raises a question -  is decentralization really necessary? Personally, I do not mind centralisation as long as there is transparency. We can transfer value across countries, store it in contracts and even sell and buy assets like stocks and bonds in the matter of a few seconds if they are bought and sold using blockchain - there will probably be a middle entity with whom we have to deal with, but we will have better settling times and more transparency and ease of management of the transactions. 

Given the direction Blockchain is going, we can probably get very high transaction time and low throughput with decentralization in near future, but I personally think decentralization should be implemented only when it is a necessary solution to the problem we are solving  rather than an additional feature to make it sound cool. Blindly decentralizing the applications (like decentralized Uber) we have today might not sustain in the long run but we will be able to use blockchain to decentralize where trustlessness should be a necessary feature - like electronic voting systems, or repository of personal information.
When it comes to assets on blockchain, I think it makes more sense to keep track of ownership and details of the creator of an asset on blockchain - and this is the value which we can create.
