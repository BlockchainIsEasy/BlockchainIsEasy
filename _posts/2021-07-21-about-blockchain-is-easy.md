This blog is for all those people out there who want to understand blockchain but just cannot wrap their head around the concepts or don't find the time to learn them. We tried to make sure every article is very easy to read and gave priority to understanding the concepts more than the technical jargon and specifics. Our goal was to create a blog where people can read articles at the end of a hectic day at work or college and still be able to relax and learn. Enjoy!
