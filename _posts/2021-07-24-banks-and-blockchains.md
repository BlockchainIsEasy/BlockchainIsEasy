A year ago I started learning the core concepts of BitCoin and blockchain. I will be honest here, I did it for the money. I wanted to be a crypto billionaire ( don’t judge me, dreams are free of cost ). But before investing in crypto, I wanted to understand crypto and through the course of my research and learning, one thing kept bugging me. 

What gives bitcoin value? Stocks are backed by the performance and the assets of a company, but what about crypto currency? What gives it intrinsic value?

In order to understand the value of crypto assets, I had to understand money. Now an integral part of understanding money is understanding banks. I realised my parents and I trusted all our money with a bank but never really understood how a bank worked. When I was a kid I used to think banks stored all our money in a big vault, and when I grew up I didn't have time to think about banks - I was busy making money. Oh the irony! 

Lately, I have learned that Banks do not save my money, rather, they borrow my/your money. They take money from lenders and give it to borrowers. Only they pay the lenders a small interest and charge the borrower a huge interest, and the difference is theirs to keep. I also found out that banks can lend more than they borrowed. That is, if people like me have lent (saved - is the colloquial term) 5000 bucks, the bank can lend more than 5000 to people who want to borrow depending on the rate set by the Central Bank of the country. This rate is called the ‘reserve requirement’. If the reserve requirement is 10%, the bank can borrow 5000 bucks and lend 50,000 bucks. The bank just created 45,000 bucks out of thin air !!! Now if the people who borrowed the 50,000 bucks do not return the money, the bank can declare bankruptcy and the people who lent (and thought they are saving) 5000 rupees lose their money. The bankers get to walk away without charges usually.

But why are banks so important? Personally, I think it is because of one simple reason. People need a safe place to save their money. If I worked hard to save 5000 bucks in my cupboard and the money was stolen overnight, forget compensating me for my lost money, nobody will believe I had 5000 rupees in the first place. If I save it in a bank, whenever I need my money back I will go to the bank, they will look into their ledger and if their ledger says I have the money i want in my account, they will give it to me. Now, if it is a ledger you want, you can go to any guy with a computer to save your money. But, the reason we go to banks is because we trust them. Any random person with a ledger can change the contents of the ledger if he stands to gain money from it, but banks usually won't. 

Now what if i tell you, there is a way where you can record the money you have to a ledger, and query it to prove you have the said amount of money whenever you want to pay or withdraw, and you do not have to go to a bank to access this ledger and prove it? Imagine everyone in the world has a copy of a ledger - so literally anyone can prove you are entitled to the money you saved.

If trust is what you need to save money, what is more trustworthy than the entire world knowing you did something? But we are concerned about our privacy now, aren’t we?

We do not want to announce to the entire world how much money we have. What if, and stay with me here - what if the whole world can prove you have money in your account but they do not have to know who you are?

Literally anyone can create an account on the distributed ledger,  and everytime you want to spend or receive money, the world will stand as your witness and can see and prove how much money you have in your account but nobody knows who you are. Now that, my dear friends, is the bitcoin blockchain.

Just like Dollar is the currency in the US and any transaction in the US can be done using Dollars, BitCoin is the currency/token of the bitcoin Blockchain system and any transaction in the Blockchain can be done using bitcoin.
