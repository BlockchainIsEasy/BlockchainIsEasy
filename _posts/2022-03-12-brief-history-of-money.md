As humans, I feel we are all wired to pursue abundance and prosperity throughout our lives - and one of the most common and highly explored methods of experiencing prosperity and abundance in life is, you guessed it right, becoming rich. Ever since I was a child, I always thought that being rich is having a lot of money - I still do, to a certain extent. However, the more I tried to understand money, the more confused I was. Before you start wondering, NO - this is not an article which will tell you how you can become a millionaire in one year ( I have read articles which tell you how you can become one in a month ! ). After more than two years of reading about the evolution of money, and deliberation, I think I am finally ready to write about money. 

Money is not a paper note or a number on the ledger of a bank. Money is a store of value which is used by humans to increase productivity. I feel I will be able to explain this sentence much better with the help of a small story - the story of the evolution of money.

NOTE : The idea of this article is not to explain the chronological order of evolution of money since tracking the evolution of money closely is a mammoth task - different civilisations followed whatever seemed to work for them. But in this article, I try to weave the events which led to the creation of modern day fiat currency logically for ease of understanding.

<b>Barter System and Promissory Notes ( ~6000BC to ~1000AD ):<b>

The story starts back in the stone ages ( Yeap! ). Eren was the king of Paradis Island - a huge island inhabited by thousands of humans who specialize in various skills. While few farmers were really good at growing brinjals, there were a bunch of cobblers who made amazing leather shoes. Alice was a cobbler whose family wanted to eat brinjal - and Bob grew the best brinjal on the island. Alice went to Bob, and gave him her fairest pair of leather boots and asked for brinjals in return. However, Bob was not interested in leather boots at all - Bob wanted to feed his family some meat. Now Alice went to Charlie who had plenty of meat hoping she could get some meat in exchange for her leather boots, only to find out Charlie wanted neither boots nor brinjals but a horse to round up his poultry. Now I do not have to explain why the barter system failed - we all learned that in school. But Eren’s solution to these problems was not money - Eren had to learn a lot before he could create ‘money’. What Eren did was create a ‘promissory note’ (or something along those lines - we do not know what it was called exactly, this happened very long ago after all :p). In this system, when Alice wanted brinjals from Bob, she would go to Bob and give him a promissory note - promising that she would give Bob a pair of leather boots whenever he wanted ( since he clearly does not want them today ) in exchange for brinjals today. If Bob wanted meat and Charlie wanted brinjals, Bob can now just exchange the promissory note Alice gave him for some meat. That is probably how modern financial credit systems started - the first form of money was more of a ‘promise’ to return value rather than a ‘store’ of value.

<b>Common Store of Value - Gold ( ~700BC ) :</b>

    Eren soon realized that promissory notes did not solve the problem entirely. Alice promised Bob one pair of leather boots in return for 1kg of brinjals, Bob wanted 2 kgs of meat for his family but Charlie is willing to give 2kgs of meat in exchange for 2 pairs of leather boots. Bob told Alice he is willing to give her 2kgs brinjals in exchange for the promise of two leather boots, but Alice is happy with 1kg and does not want anymore - you see the problem here. King Eren might not be the smartest man in the world but he is a fast learner. There are a very few places on Paradis island from where Gold, a metal considered very precious by the people of Paradis can be mined - and mining Gold needs a lot of effort and labor. Not everyone can mine Gold. Since Eren is the King of Paradis, he had enough labor and power to mine Gold. Eren announced that every transaction in Paradis island could be done by exchanging Gold - and only the King can create Gold since it would become a huge problem if everyone started creating Gold ( He chose Gold specifically to counter this issue ) . He created a place called ‘Market’ where people can come and sell their stuff for Gold, and with this Gold, people can buy anything they want in the same market. How will you decide how much 2kgs of Bob’s brinjals cost? Simple - Bob can sell it to the person who is willing to pay the highest amount of Gold. Supply meets demand at the market, and Gold can be used as a common store of value for every citizen of Paradis island.

<b>The Stock Market ( Amsterdam stock exchange - 1600s ) :</b>

With the creation of a common store of value, people were able to get what they wanted easily. Peace and prosperity ensued on the island of Paradis. The goods were being distributed efficiently among people and citizens were honing their skills and using creative ways to sell their skill for more Gold in the market. As people had plenty of resources and were comfortably living their lives, the population of Paradis Island suddenly exploded. The resources available on the island were no longer enough to feed the entire population of the island. But Paradis island now had the gift of skilled builders - Eren, after consulting with the builders, came up with a great idea. They would build a house which would float on water - they called it a ship. In this ship, the best soldiers of Paradis island would float on the sea and go to the countries nearby, conquer their resources and bring them back home. But there was one problem - Eren did not have enough Gold in his treasury to build a ship(s) big enough to conquer other countries. So Eren asked the people of Paradis to contribute to building the ship. For every Gold a citizen gave for the building of the ship, he/she would get one ‘stock’. Once these soldiers go to foreign lands and bring resources back home, you will be given a ‘share’ of the resources which will be proportional to the number of stocks you are holding. If the soldiers do not come back, you will not get anything. 

<b>Advent of Banks and Credit Systems ( First bank - 1600s ) :</b>

Soldiers invaded foreign lands and returned with plenty of resources, Paradis even colonized the foreign land to get a constant supply of resources. Citizens who invested in stocks are now very very rich from all the resources they gained from the success of the soldiers in the ship. Now with abundance of resources and prosperity, Paradis has become an island where citizens could pursue their dreams, use their skills in a creative way to create value for the island. With advancements in science, people of Paradis invented the printing press, the steam engine and even automobiles. The problem was Paradis did not have enough smooth roads for people to travel across using their new automobiles !  And as the population increased, Eren needed more ships to send people across seas to gather enough resources. Till now, Eren could just mine Gold whenever he needed for such projects or ask people of Paradis to buy stocks, but now the amount of Gold needed to fund all these projects is much higher than the amount of Gold which can be mined in the short term and people of Paradis either do not have enough money to invest in all these projects or they do not think that investment in automobiles and ships will make them rich. 

If only Eren could borrow Gold for now and pay it back when the ships come back and the toll on the roads has been paid! Promissory notes were not such a bad idea after all! Enter banks. Now, the problem is that, Paradis does not have enough gold in the short term to fund their projects. So Eren announced to the people of Paradis that from that day, he will be printing paper currency ( using the printing press they invented, of course ) and people are to use that paper to do all their transactions instead of Gold. But the people do not have to worry, people can always exchange X amount of paper for 1kg of Gold. If people can always exchange paper money for Gold, how will Eren borrow money to finance all his ship and road building projects? Sit tight, this is where things get interesting.

Eren created a ‘bank’ where people can go to ‘borrow’ money to build a house, or start a business or save their money for future use.  Currently, anyone can exchange X amount of paper money for 1kg of Gold, but banks can lend people 5X amount of paper money even though they have only 1kg of gold with them in their vaults. Why can banks do this? Because the people of Paradis are hardworking and industrious. It is very unlikely that all the money which is borrowed is defaulted. Thus, if the value of total Gold in Paradis island is G with the help of banks, people can borrow up to 5G and pay it back with interest. Thus, banks not only store and lend money - they also create money and when people have more capital for their projects, the productivity of the nation as a whole increases - the amount of Gold which can be mined in Paradis island will no longer constrain human productivity. Now, Eren will go to the bank and ask for money to finance his Ships and Roads and promises to pay the bank back with interest once he the ships come back with resources and the roads start earning money from tolls paid by travelers. He can do this even though the amount of Gold present in the island is not enough to finance all these projects because of banks.

NOTE : Although paper as a form of currency came much before banks, the power of currency to increase human productivity could be realized with the advent of banks ( In the form of currency which can be lent by banks ) .

<b>Fiat Currency ( 1800s de-linking currency with Gold Standards ) : </b>

Everything was going fine for a while. People were borrowing money from the bank to finance their projects and/or companies, earning profits and becoming wealthy. Looking at the wealth amassed more people started borrowing money and banks happily gave it to them for their own business. Remember how Eren promised to exchange X amount of paper currency for 1kg of Gold? Well if there is total G kgs of Gold in Paradis island, banks lent people 5GX amount of currency. Everything was fine when people borrowed money, put it to productive use and paid it back with interest after creating value. But as time passed, people who borrowed money stopped putting it to productive use. Looking at unproductive projects getting funding from banks in the island, the people of the island, scared, started wondering if they would really get 1kg Gold if they gave X currency to Eren. Since there is 5GX currency on the island, what if people come with more than 1.5GX or 2GX worth currency and ask Eren to give them Gold? Since there is only G kgs gold in the island which was mined ( or present ), it will become impossible ! As the word spread, more people started panicking and more people approached Eren to convert their paper currency to Gold before Eren ran out of G kgs of Gold. Since there was 5GX worth currency on the island, Eren knew it would be impossible to convert all the currency of the people into Gold. Something had to be done.

![brief-history-of-money-3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/brief_history_of_money_2.png)

Eren then decides to sever links between currency and Gold - or as the people of Paradis said, Eren took currency off ‘Gold Standard’. Now nobody can approach Eren with X currency and ask for 1kg of Gold. However, people can still use the currency in market places, banks can still lend the currency, only Eren, who is the King (Government) can print this paper currency and whoever prints this currency other than Eren will be jailed and whoever refuses to recognise the value of currency will be sent to jail as well. This currency which Eren created, taken off the ‘Gold Standard’ is more or less how the currencies in today’s world came to be. This currency is called ‘fiat currency’.

Now what are the implications of fiat currency? Can governments in the world keep printing money to increase the productivity of their nations forever? These are questions which I will answer in another article. But I hope this article gave you a little bit of insight about what money is and how it works.

Until next time!
