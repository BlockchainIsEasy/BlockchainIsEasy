Investing in cryptocurrency is more than buying a coin and praying for its price to increase. Since the advent of ethereum, many organisations which will provide financial services in a trustless, decentralised manner have popped up. Thus, a new field - 'Decentralised Finance’ was born. Anyone in this world with a computer can borrow money or lend money to earn interest from these organisations.

In this blog series, we will explore the most popular decentralised finance organisations, how they work and how one can invest in/ borrow from them.
