I"~<p>One of the major selling points of Bitcoin when it was launched, apart from the fact that it was completely decentralized, was that it is <u>Programmable Money</u>. I can create a transaction in the Bitcoin network to pay someone at a point in time in the future and it will be executed without fail. But the level of programming we can do in the Bitcoin network is limited.</p>
