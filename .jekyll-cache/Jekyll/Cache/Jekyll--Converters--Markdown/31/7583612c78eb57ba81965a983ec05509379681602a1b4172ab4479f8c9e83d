I"ó<p>If Alice wanted to transfer 10,000 bucks to Bob, she would go to a bank and ask the clerk to perform a transaction. The clerk will record this transaction in his ledger, remove 10,000 bucks from Aliceâ€™s account and add 10,000 bucks to Bobâ€™s account. The ledger is not distributed since the clerk in the bank is the only person who has it. Now if Bob wants to transfer these 10,000 bucks to Charlie, he has to go to the bank again, ask the clerk who records the transaction in the ledger.</p>
