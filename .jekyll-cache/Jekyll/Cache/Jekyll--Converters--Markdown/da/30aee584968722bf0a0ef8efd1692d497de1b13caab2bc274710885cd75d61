I"œ<p>We are almost there! In this article, we will try to put together all we have learned in our previous articles and see how the Blockchain works. Now before we get started, it would be useful to see what we donâ€™t want participants on our blockchain network to do.</p>
<ol>
  <li>We do not want them to spend the money they do not have,</li>
  <li>We do not want people to add fraudulent transactions to the network.</li>
</ol>

<p>To explain these problems in more detail, let us take the help of our dear friends Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice wants to send Bob 100 bucks. But she should not be able to send the money she does not have in her account - seems like a pretty basic requirement right? This problem can be tackled by using Digital Signatures. When someone sends you some bitcoin, they send it to your bitcoin address (your public key) and you can access and spend these bitcoins only if you have the private key associated with the public key. Thus, Alice can give 100 bucks to Bob only if she has that much bitcoin in her bitcoin address and she has the private key corresponding to the bitcoin address. This makes sure you cannot spend the money you do not have and nobody else other than you (given you are the only person who has the private key) will be able to spend those Bitcoins you have.</p>

<p>Before talking about fraudulent transactions, let us consider what would happen if everyone could just mine and add blocks to the blockchain network without any effort. Our friend Bob is not a nice guy and he wants to make the life of others miserable. He will create a million transactions between him and Charlie (his partner in crime) and they will send each other the same 0.001 bitcoin. They both are spamming the network and poor miners are adding these transactions to their blocks and essentially the network is being polluted by useless transactions and people who want to transfer money for genuine purposes are getting stalled. This can be avoided by adding a <u>transaction fee</u>. If I want to send Alice money urgently but Bob and Charlie are spamming the network, Iâ€™ll give the miner a small amount of fee to add my transaction to the block first, this will make sure even though Bob and Charlie are spamming the network, the miner, who is motivated by the fee I am giving him will mine my transaction first (remember, mining is just a fancy way of saying adding a block). This is what <u>transaction costs</u> are on Blockchain! Every time you want to submit a transaction, you add a percentage of the amount as minerâ€™s fee. This fee is given to the miner who mines the block.</p>

<p>Now you may ask, what if a miner mines fraudulent transactions into the chain? Let us assume Charlie is a miner. He has sent 10 Bitcoins to Bob. Hence, naturally, the transaction should read, Charlie sent 10 Bitcoins to Bob. But now, Charlie who is also a miner alters this transaction and mines the block stating <u><b>Bob sent 10 Bitcoins to Charlie</b></u>. This is possible, but, this is not easy. Let me present you with some numbers. On average, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/heres-how-much-energy-it-really-takes-to-mine-bitcoin-and-why-people-are-concerned/">mining one Bitcoin transaction</a> takes <u><b>1,544</b></u> kWh to complete. In plain terms, this means it will take, for an average household, <u><b>53 days</b></u> of power. So if Charlie here were to mine this transaction in 53 days, by then, the actual chain wouldâ€™ve grown much larger than Charliesâ€™ here, leaving Charliesâ€™ chain invalid. Charlie here spent all his time and energy in creating a fraudulent transaction whereas he couldâ€™ve been a good participant and earned the minersâ€™ fee if they participated fairly in mining blocks. Here we can see our Proof of Work article coming into play. Miners can get together to combine their computing power and try mining transactions. If they succeed, they get paid the miners fee for being honest.</p>

<p>And just like that, with a digital signature and proof of work, we have a decentralized system of sending and receiving value. The actual bitcoin blockchain network works similarly, with a few added complexities which we will explore some other day, but for today I think it would be enough for us to recall our understanding of how the bitcoin blockchain works on a high level.</p>
<ol>
  <li>A person on the network broadcasts a transaction to the network - Remember one can broadcast a transaction (that is, send money to others) only if one has enough Bitcoin in onesâ€™ address.</li>
  <li>Miners, who are present on the blockchain network will collect all such transactions and mine a block out of them.</li>
  <li>For the minerâ€™s block to be considered valid, the miner has to prove that they have worked hard in creating the block. The miner has to create a hash of the block which has â€˜Xâ€™ number of zeroes in the beginning (X is determined depending on the traffic on the network).</li>
  <li>Once the miner creates a block with required proof of work, he/she will broadcast this block to the entire network.</li>
  <li>It is difficult to generate Proof of Work, but it is easy to verify it (see our previous article on Proof of Work). Thus, once the miner broadcasts the block, everyone else in the network will see if the block satisfies the Proof of Work condition, and if it does, they add the block to their current chain.</li>
  <li>The show goes on for every transaction and block.</li>
</ol>

<p>And with that, we come to the end of the series. We wanted to explain the very basics of Blockchain and we hope we have done that well. There are many more topics we want to cover and articles we want to write, we shall keep coming up with new content. Until next time, stay tuned.</p>
