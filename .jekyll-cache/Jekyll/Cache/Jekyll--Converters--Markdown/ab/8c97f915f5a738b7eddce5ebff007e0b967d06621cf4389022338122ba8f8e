I"Š<p>Today we shall talk about the most important aspect of finance - Borrowing and Lending. When banks normally set interest rates for the funds deposited with or borrowed from them, it depends on various macroeconomic and competitive factors. But the bottom line is, at the end of the day, the bank is the â€˜centralâ€™ authority which determines the interest rates for its deposits and loans. 
Now if you want to buy a Tesla, and you cannot afford to pay the whole amount at once (for the sake of this article let us assume Tesla costs $48,000), you can go to a bank, give a downpayment of $10,000 and borrow $38000. Ofcourse, the bank will not give you the $38,000 for free - until you pay back the $38,000 with interest to the bank, the bank is entitled to the car. If you are not able to pay back $38,000 + interest, the bank can take away your car. In this case, the car is your â€˜collateralâ€™.</p>
