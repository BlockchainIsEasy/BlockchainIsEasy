I"<p>Now in all our articles, we represented transactions with <u>Alice paid Bob 10,000 bucks</u>. It helped us understand the concepts, but now it is time to think about how transactions are stored in the Bitcoin Blockchain ledger. Say Alice has to pay Bob <b>one</b> bitcoin. First of all, Alice has to have <b>one</b> bitcoin associated with her bitcoin address. Now how does the blockchain check if Alice has that much money in her address? It is much simpler than you might think. To spend money, I need to possess money. And in order to possess money, someone has to give some money to me. I can only spend money someone has given me (or I have <b>mined</b>, in the case of cryptocurrency), I cannot create money from thin air. The same concept is used in Bitcoin Blockchain.</p>
